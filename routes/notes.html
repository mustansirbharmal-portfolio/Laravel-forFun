// NOTES OF LARAVEL

INSTALLATION AND CREATING PROCCES OF CREATING LARAVEL PROJECT

STEP 1 = Install PHP from php.net
STEP 2 = Store PHP in Program Files
STEP 3 = Install Composer  and pass the location path Installed PHP i.e C:\Program Files\php-8.3.6
STEP 4 = Open Command Prompt 
STEP 5 = Now write "composer" as command
STEP 6 = Create first project by writing -> composer create-project laravel/laravel Laravel
STEP 7 = Now you will get "Failed to Download Error" go to php.ini file and uncomment zip and fileinfo
STEP 8 = Create New project in the same way -> composer create-project laravel/laravel LARAVEL, now your project folder is created successfully
STEP 9 = This will create Folder in Users/HP by default
STEP 10 = Locate the folder to htdocs.

// NOTES
COMPOSER = Composer is an package library of LARAVEL, composer is just like our NodeJS NPM. We can different types of packages using Composer

// BASIC COMMANDS IN LARAVEL
STEP 1 = Open VS Code and open project folder
STEP 2 = Open Terminal and run the command "php artisan serve"
STEP 3 = After running this command you will get an Localhost URL if you open it in browser then you will SEE YOUR FIRST LARAVEL APPLICATION

php artisan serve = The Laravel PHP artisan serve command helps running applications on the PHP development server. 
                     As a developer, you can use Laravel artisan serve to develop and test various functions within the application.

// NOTE THAT you can also rename the file name of artisan to any file suppose to rename it to Mustansir then when you run
   artisan command then it would be like: php Mustansir serve, you are still able to access your page. Because code is main not the file name.

// When you redirect to your First Laravel Site, one question arise in your mind that where is the code of this LARAVEL site, so it
   is basically in welcome.blade.php file. How I know this thing, so press Ctrl+Shift+F to search the content, copy any content from
   your website and paste it there, now you will find that this content is coming from  welcome.blade.php file which is in the view folder.

// So now question arise that how this page is render in my LARAVEL Site. To answer again press Ctrl+Shift+F and copy some 
   content of your website and paste it you will find "web.php". 

// "web.php" is the actual file because of which welcome.blade.php page is displaying

// ROUTES IN LARAVEL -> web.php

// 1st WAY
/* 
Route::view('/', function () {
    return view('wel');
});                                 */

// 2nd way
Route::view('/','home');



-> Here, '/' means home page and I am saying that reload wel page as your website home page
-> Here, I am returning wel as home page through  return view('wel');.
-> view is global function in LARAVEL. Basically, to make our site different views we use view.
-> All views are stored in resources/views directory. 
-> 2nd way is more easier than 1st way.
-> Views in Laravel are implemented as Blade templates.
-> Blade is a templating engine that provides a simple syntax for creating reusable templates.
-> Blade templates are most prominently stored in the resources/views directory and also have a . blade

IMP IMP: Actually, see our website execution starts from web.php file  in LARAVEL because first it sees if its is a home page than it reloads the
         content of home page.


    // GIT COMMANDS

1) git init = This command is used to initialize the git
2) git add . = This command means add all the files and folders of Laravel folder into the git
3) git commit -m "Let's begin" = This command is used for commit and -m stands for messsge which is used to pass message "Let's begin".
4) Now open another Terminal
5) Now we will connect our github account to build repository there from here.

// Commands to create a new repository on the command line
echo "# Laravel-forFun" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/mustansirbharmal-portfolio/Laravel-forFun.git
git push -u origin main

// Commands which I don't understand
1) git branch -M main: 
-> This command renames the default branch from master to main. 
-> This is a common practice to use more inclusive terminology in software development.
-> Basically, this command is used to change from master to main directory


2) git remote add origin https://github.com/mustansirbharmal-portfolio/Laravel-forFun.git:

-> This command sets up a remote repository named origin and associates it with the 
   URL https://github.com/mustansirbharmal-portfolio/Laravel-forFun.git. 

-> This URL typically points to the repository on GitHub.

3) git push -u origin main:
-> This command pushes the committed changes from the local main branch to the remote repository (origin) on GitHub.
-> The -u flag sets up tracking, so in the future, you can simply use git push without specifying the branch and remote. 
-> This is the first push to the repository after setup.

NOTE: -u is used for tracking, and because of this in future if you want to add more file or folders to your folder
      you don't need to write remote and origin, you just need to write "git push".
