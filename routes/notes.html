// NOTES OF LARAVEL

INSTALLATION AND CREATING PROCCES OF CREATING LARAVEL PROJECT

STEP 1 = Install PHP from php.net
STEP 2 = Store PHP in Program Files
STEP 3 = Install Composer  and pass the location path Installed PHP i.e C:\Program Files\php-8.3.6
STEP 4 = Open Command Prompt 
STEP 5 = Now write "composer" as command
STEP 6 = Create first project by writing -> composer create-project laravel/laravel Laravel
STEP 7 = Now you will get "Failed to Download Error" go to php.ini file and uncomment zip and fileinfo
STEP 8 = Create New project in the same way -> composer create-project laravel/laravel LARAVEL, now your project folder is created successfully
STEP 9 = This will create Folder in Users/HP by default
STEP 10 = Locate the folder to htdocs.

// NOTES
COMPOSER = Composer is an package library of LARAVEL, composer is just like our NodeJS NPM. We can different types of packages using Composer

// BASIC COMMANDS IN LARAVEL
STEP 1 = Open VS Code and open project folder
STEP 2 = Open Terminal and run the command "php artisan serve"
STEP 3 = After running this command you will get an Localhost URL if you open it in browser then you will SEE YOUR FIRST LARAVEL APPLICATION

php artisan serve = The Laravel PHP artisan serve command helps running applications on the PHP development server. 
                     As a developer, you can use Laravel artisan serve to develop and test various functions within the application.

// NOTE THAT you can also rename the file name of artisan to any file suppose to rename it to Mustansir then when you run
   artisan command then it would be like: php Mustansir serve, you are still able to access your page. Because code is main not the file name.

// When you redirect to your First Laravel Site, one question arise in your mind that where is the code of this LARAVEL site, so it
   is basically in welcome.blade.php file. How I know this thing, so press Ctrl+Shift+F to search the content, copy any content from
   your website and paste it there, now you will find that this content is coming from  welcome.blade.php file which is in the view folder.

// So now question arise that how this page is render in my LARAVEL Site. To answer again press Ctrl+Shift+F and copy some 
   content of your website and paste it you will find "web.php". 

// "web.php" is the actual file because of which welcome.blade.php page is displaying

// ROUTES IN LARAVEL -> web.php

// 1st WAY
/* 
Route::view('/', function () {
    return view('wel');
});                                 */

// 2nd way
Route::view('/','home');



-> Here, '/' means home page and I am saying that reload wel page as your website home page
-> Here, I am returning wel as home page through  return view('wel');.
-> view is global function in LARAVEL. Basically, to make our site different views we use view.
-> All views are stored in resources/views directory. 
-> 2nd way is more easier than 1st way.
-> Views in Laravel are implemented as Blade templates.
-> Blade is a templating engine that provides a simple syntax for creating reusable templates.
-> Blade templates are most prominently stored in the resources/views directory and also have a . blade

IMP IMP: Actually, see our website execution starts from web.php file  in LARAVEL because first it sees if its is a home page than it reloads the
         content of home page.
